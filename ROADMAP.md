# ResuMatch Roadmap

This file provides an overview of the development plan for **ResuMatch**, an AI-powered tool for ATS-optimized resume building and job matching.

The project is divided into **incremental phases** to ensure clear milestones and continuous progress.

---

## **Phase 0: Project Setup (Completed)**

### Key Tasks:
- [x] Create GitHub repository: `ResuMatch`
- [x] Initialize the project directory with folders: `backend`, `frontend`
- [x] Add `.gitignore` file for Python and Node.js (frontend), and set up `README.md`
- [x] Set up a Python virtual environment (`venv`) and install core dependencies:
  - `Flask`, `Werkzeug`, `python-docx`, `PyPDF2`

---

## **Phase 1: Backend Core API**
**Goal:** Build a foundational API to handle resume file uploads, parsing, and keyword-based ATS analysis.

### Key Tasks:
- [ ] Create an endpoint to **upload resumes** (`/upload`) and save files to the server.  
- [ ] Implement logic to validate file types (accepting only `.pdf` or `.docx`).
- [ ] Use `PyPDF2` to extract text from PDFs.  
- [ ] Use `python-docx` to extract text from `.docx` files.
- [ ] Build a parsing function to process resumes and identify:
  - [ ] Name
  - [ ] Key Skills
  - [ ] Experience
  - [ ] Education
- [ ] Create an endpoint to **return parsed resume data** in JSON format (`/parse`).
- [ ] Create an endpoint to **compare resume content with ATS-friendly keywords** (`/analyze`).

---

## **Phase 2: Frontend MVP**
**Goal:** Build a simple, user-friendly interface for uploading resumes and displaying analysis results.

### Key Tasks:
- [ ] Initialize a React.js frontend app inside the `frontend` folder.
- [ ] Add a **drag-and-drop file uploader** for `.pdf` and `.docx` resumes.
- [ ] Display the extracted resume data (name, skills, experience) in a table or interactive card format.
- [ ] Show basic ATS analysis results (e.g., keyword match percentage).
- [ ] Connect the React.js frontend to the Flask backend using Axios (or Fetch API).
- [ ] Add necessary error handling (e.g., invalid file types or frontend/backend errors).

---

## **Phase 3: ATS Optimization Tools**
**Goal:** Add AI/NLP-driven features to improve resume compatibility with ATS systems.

### Key Tasks:
- [ ] Create an endpoint where users can input job descriptions to extract:
  - [ ] Job-specific keywords (e.g., technologies, soft skills, certifications).
  - [ ] Missing qualifications.
- [ ] Use libraries like `spaCy` or `Transformers` to:
  - [ ] Perform Named Entity Recognition (NER) on the job description to extract roles, required skills, etc.
  - [ ] Analyze the user's resume for missing keywords and offer suggestions.
- [ ] Extend the frontend to display suggested resume improvements:
  - [ ] Missing keywords for specific roles.
  - [ ] Recommendations for rephrasing or expanding sections (e.g., achievements, skills).
- [ ] Add a **real-time ATS "score" indicator**.

---

## **Phase 4: Resume Builder**
**Goal:** Allow users to create resumes from scratch using structured forms and generate downloadable documents.

### Key Tasks:
- [ ] Create structured forms for inputting resume details:
  - Name, Contact Info, Skills, Education, Experience, Certifications, etc.
- [ ] Use templates (HTML or Jinja2 templates) to generate different resume styles.
- [ ] Allow users to download resumes in `.PDF` and `.DOCX` formats.
- [ ] Implement logic for customizing templates (e.g., font size, layout).

---

## **Phase 5: Deployment**
**Goal:** Deploy the projectâ€™s backend and frontend to make it accessible to users.

### Key Tasks:
- [ ] Deploy the Flask backend to Heroku or AWS Lambda.
- [ ] Deploy the React frontend to Netlify or Vercel.
- [ ] Set up a domain for the hosted app (e.g., `www.resumatch.com`).
- [ ] Configure CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions for:
  - Running tests automatically on pull requests.
  - Automated deployments.

---

## **Phase 6: Advanced Features (Future Enhancements)**
**Goal:** Add extra features to make ResuMatch more intelligent and useful for users.

### Key Ideas:
- [ ] **Job Board Integration**:
  - Fetch job descriptions directly from LinkedIn or other APIs.
- [ ] **Resume Assessment Report**:
  - Generate a detailed report for users showing the effectiveness of their resume based on ATS requirements.
- [ ] **Language Support**:
  - Add multi-language support for non-English resumes and job descriptions.
- [ ] **Industry-Specific Optimization**:
  - Provide targeted suggestions tailored to industries like tech, healthcare, legal, etc.
- [ ] **Interview Preparation Helper**:
  - Use the uploaded resume to predict and generate customized interview questions.
- [ ] **AI-Based Career Suggestions**:
  - Recommend career paths based on the user's resume.
